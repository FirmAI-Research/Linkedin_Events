The events of the last year have made digital experience an even higher priority, as maintaining robust, straightforward relationships with partners, suppliers and customers online has become essential. In the current environment, it’s more crucial than ever for your sales and account teams to form deep, personal relationships with customers based on an individualized understanding of their needs, behaviors, and history. If they feel like glorified order-takers because they don’t have enough data to get to know the customer or serve them as responsively as possible, they can’t grow account values or CSAT. Sofbang specializes in helping asset-intensive businesses (manufacturers, utilities, and construction/manufacturing firms) increase customer engagement to maximize satisfaction and retention while setting sales team up to grow account potential through a 360° understanding of the customer. We achieve this by connecting ERP (Oracle EBS, PeopleSoft JD Edwards, ERP Cloud, etc.) and Salesforce in real time to create a live single source of truth for customer data. From there, we use Experience Cloud to create a simplified, highly visual engagement platform where your customers, partners, and suppliers can access all their documentation in one place, make orders, pay invoices, communicate with their designated support team, and beyond. If you’re intrigued by the possibilities of what we’re describing above, are looking to uncork the potential of your sales and account teams, or want to engage your customers in a more automated, satisfying way, it’s time for us to sit down and have a conversation. In our 20-minute discovery session, we’ll spend time getting to know you, your current IT environment, your approach to customer engagement, and your day-to-day challenges and pain points. From there, we’ll help you create a personalized roadmap to deeper customer engagement, CX modernization, and account value maximization. There are absolutely no obligations whatsoever – this is a risk-free chance for you to get a look at your potential future state.

This resulted in a fragmented and inconsistent tech stack across LinkedIn and a less than savory member notification experience. To combat this disjointed experience, Linkedin set up a small team to build an orchestration layer, the Air-Traffic Controller (ATC).

In this episode, I will talk to Yali Sassoon - the co-founder of Snowplow Analytics - about the Future of Customer Journey Analytics. Understanding their customers is a key desire of companies, whether in marketing, product or another context. Yet, for most brands, it remains challenging. Why is that? How can we overcome these challenges? What‘s the benefit of doing so? Similar to me and my consulting experiences, Yali is sure that it‘s not only a technological problem. Measuring customer journeys is one thing, but reacting to them a much different. Ultimately, you want to create the best possiblefor your users, influence them to become great and loyal customers. Yali will share his vast experience around this topic, as a former management consultant, entrepreneur, and co-founder of Snowplow. The world of customer journey tracking and analytics is at an exciting turning point. Many would say it‘s a big unknown future ahead, which is limiting our customer understanding. However, I see it as a big opportunity that comes with the necessity to change and adapt. From years of „let‘s track and analyze everything we can“, to digitally naked and exposed users - finally personal data privacy and fit-for-purpose analytics will take over. What will the Future of Customer Journey Analytics look like? How will legislation (like GDPR etc.), ITP, and all other sorts of tracking prevention techniques shape it? But most importantly: What can I do as a company to stay ahead of the competition and not get lost? Yali is the co-founder of Snowplow, the „behavioral data platform“. Clients use Snowplow for different reasons, from having a fully controlled Google Analytics alternative to building their own data pipeline in-house to empowering advanced data use cases. It‘s also the third most-used web analytics tracker worldwide, so Yali and his colleagues are real experts when it comes to understanding and analyzing customer behavior (way beyond web analytics). I‘ve seen and built many business intelligence setups with Snowplow raw data as a core source of the user clickstream, it‘s a joy to work with and we will explain why in this episode, too. Last but not least, we‘ll talk about Neotree, a non-profit organization that Yali is very active in. Neotree‘s mission is to help fighting child mortality in low-resource settings with the help of technology, allowing healthcare staff to make better and faster decisions about treatment in real-time. LOOKING FORWARD TO SEE YOU! JUST RSVP TO THIS EVENT🙂 YOU‘LL FIND THE INTERVIEW BROADCAST LINK HERE."

The segments that did well in the pandemic (essential retail- e.g. grocery, e-commerce, home improvement etc.) are flush with resources to drive the next set of initiatives, while segments that struggled have to fight harder to get the attention of the customer. Retail customers continue to demand convenience, seamlessand the right bargain, and the pandemic has instilled focus around health, safety and trust. This brings an unique channel for all Retail CXOs. They need to drive new digital capabilities at scale, find new revenue avenues and grow the topline, while optimizing costs and controlling spend or revenue leaks. While CIOs are trying to accomplish both by using the cost savings to pay for digital transformation, it will not be an easy journey. To compete in the post-COVID world, retailers will need digital processes to create intelligent and safe hyper-personalized, omnichannel experiences for their customers. They will need to reimagine their supply chains to account for changingbehaviors. And they will need to make their workforce more agile, productive, and flexible.

Some of the main themes that emerged: FROM ONSITE TO OFFSITE As might be expected, the pandemic brought a rapid—and sometimes enduring—shift to remote work for many CPAs.

We’ve adapted, adjusted and benefited from a lot of lessons learned’ Below are some of the takeaways from the last two tax seasons, and although we hope it’s an experience we never have to face again, these strategies can improve the process—even in the best of times. Planning has never been more important. Filing early is still a great strategy Know your firm, your clients and your staff. In this online CPE webinar, the following major questions will be answered: How did this past tax season go? Which factors contributed to the mess that the last two tax seasons were?

During the pandemic, we’ve learned online care delivery can save time and money, while the reduced risk has made even skeptics embrace change. Yet 40% of respondents to a recent polling question indicated that the biggest barrier to patient trust in digital healthcare is that it is missing the human touch.

Join us for a lively discussion with a healthcare visionary and entrepreneur, an IT leader from an innovative provider organization, and the head of a product team developing next-generation IT about the tools, technologies, and touchpoints of virtual care now and in the future. We’ll consider • How virtual care will fit with other forms of care delivery, such as in-person visits • How we find the best-fit care model to engage and empower individual patients and entire populations • The role of data and analytics in measuring adoption and outcomes for new care models • Finally, the challenges of building a technology infrastructure to take remote care to the next level 𝙍𝙚𝙜𝙞𝙨𝙩𝙚𝙧 𝙣𝙤𝙬 𝙛𝙤𝙧 𝙩𝙝𝙞𝙨 𝙛𝙧𝙚𝙚 𝙇𝙞𝙣𝙠𝙚𝙙𝙄𝙣 𝙇𝙞𝙫𝙚 𝙚𝙫𝙚𝙣𝙩!

If you are selling ideas, services or products, you know: Getting to the point and presenting the benefits for your listener is increasingly difficult in a world of constant information overload. Online communication has, if anything, only exacerbated that issue. Attention is a scarce resource, and has to be earned every single time. This requires convincing, active presentation at formal meetings and, even more so, at informal occasions. Clients often find themselves lost as to what benefit you provide exactly, what distinguishes you from other providers and why your costs are higher than some of your competitors´. Every single listeren oralso wants to be addressed personally and convinced individually of your performance and price. Therefore, it is smart to engage in optimization of one’s client conversations and “fee negotiations”, since you should convince without appearing salesy! We help improve your client conversations by helping you to implement a good structure, giving you negotiation tips, and training you throughout our Speed Negotiating Series. Each Speed Negotiating event focus´ on a different aspect of the elevator pitch and gives you ample opportunity to practice - “getting across” the value of your service [benefit argumentation]. - explaining the listener value [Unique Selling Proposition] - set the (best) stage for your price argument [price argument] - best Practice examples [reflection]."

I work with dozens of leaders and here is what they are saying: ‘My team has changed due to restructures. How can I get everyone aligned and engaged?’ ‘The team doesn’t see each other every day, how can I keep engagement up in a hybrid world?’ ‘I have a very diverse team with different personalities. The constant arguments are less than productive.’ ‘I lead in a fast-moving industry and need to get things done. My team doesn’t seem to take to my direct style and speed.’ When people are understood, they engage with each other. When engagement is high, the organisations they work for thrive. DISC Flow® is an assessment tool that helps organisations solve their people problems.

This means providing a customer experience (CX) that enables customers to achieve desired outcomes—quickly and easily—through the channel of their choice. Proven during a recent survey deployed by the Utility 2030 Collaborative, utility leaders have embraced the importance of advancing customer-centricity throughout their organization. While only 25% rated themselves “high” or “very high” in customer-centricity, 77% said they aspire to be “high” or “very high” by 2030. Now they are making plans to reach their goals. During this PowerSession, additional survey results into CX priorities and investments will be shared along with research into what 2,500 utility customers say they want most from their utility. Expert panelists will provide analysis into the results, including synergies and areas of disconnect (potential CX “darlings”). “Kill your darlings,” a common piece of advice given to writers, is an exercise that involves eliminating unnecessary storylines, characters, sentences, etc., that aren’t best for the overall story. In the case of utility CX modernization, this session will expose potential “darlings” to help utilities refine their modernization plans.

At some point, we start a screening process for what we engage with and start ignoring brands and advertising, unless it’s something that we have a personal interest in. Your brand needs to battle on a daily basis to stay consistent, differentiate yourself against competition, excel inexperience, and keep yourself at the top of your customers' minds. With these challenges comes an opportunity to refine and perfect your brand and increase your market share. The best way for you to meet all these challenges is through your brand imagery. Brand imagery is more than just your logo, it is images, adverts, social media posts, videos, your website, and even the literature and advertisements in print. Brand imagery allows customers to get a “feel” for your business and who you are. Over time, consistency and repeated exposure to your imagery increases customers' trust in your brand. This workshop is designed to help you understand the role of imagery for your brand, our experts will look at the different formats available, how to better understand the role imagery plays in how you want your customers to feel about your brand, creating your style rather than using stock images and the increasing role of video and the importance of authenticity. Join our experts as we guide you through clear thinking and tangible examples."

What is Bizlytics and Why Should You Care? The Bizlytics platform allows non-technical business analysts to independently use advanced analytics to drive action and results. The ability for a business to be agile is fast becoming the norm rather than the exception. The competition, the economy or theis no longer allowing successful organizations much time to respond to changes in behavior, changes in economic conditions or changes in competitor’s offerings. There is a huge need for analytics to play a pivotal role in determining course of action. The need to create analytic solutions, quickly, effectively and creatively has never been greater. Who is this Workshop for? If you are a business director or manager who.... - is frustrated with how long it takes to build analytic solutions - wishes to be more independent of other departments and have more input and direct control of her solutions, - wants to move quickly and effectively and not be bogged down by processes inherited, - is result-oriented and want to have the ability to leverage their data in their own creative ways, ...then this workshop is for you. What are the Problems We Try to Solve in this Workshop? Drawing from our years ofin this space this workshop has been designed to serve as a step by step guide to empower your analysts to tackle: - Limited availability and poor quality of data - Limited technical resources (IT and data science) - Difficulty and time required to transfer knowledge from business to technical teams - Frustration of getting scientific insight that sits on the shelf vs. practical insight for decision-making - Deployment of insight for business use never happens or takes a long time to happen - No closed-loop to leverage insights-action-outcome for continuous self-learning and improvement.

The retail transformation has been accelerated by the COVID19 pandemic. The segments that did well in the pandemic (essential retail- e.g. grocery, e-commerce, home improvement etc.) are flush with resources to drive the next set of initiatives, while segments that struggled have to fight harder to get the attention of the customer. Retail customers continue to demand convenience, seamlessand the right bargain, and the pandemic has instilled focus around health, safety and trust. This brings an unique channel for all Retail CXOs. They need to drive new digital capabilities at scale, find new revenue avenues and grow the topline, while optimizing costs and controlling spend or revenue leaks. While CIOs are trying to accomplish both by using the cost savings to pay for digital transformation, it will not be an easy journey. To compete in the post-COVID world, retailers will need digital processes to create intelligent and safe hyper-personalized, omnichannel experiences for their customers. They will need to reimagine their supply chains to account for changingbehaviors. And they will need to make their workforce more agile, productive, and flexible. In other words, their work is cut out for them. In this panel we will discuss these topics and others that retail leaders are tackling today."

Though, there is still a kind of ambiguity around what really a Product Manager does, or should do to be a great Product Manager. Some believe an MBA is required, where some may expect them to come from an engineering background. No one definition will fit everyone. A great PM would be one who has a deep understanding of the customers, proficiency of the market & the competitors, operates with knowledge & confidence, and is able to help steer all other stakeholders in the right direction-not with the force of position or power but as a true servant leader. What becomes essentially fundamental is the skills & product thinking mindset required to be a great PM and how can one acquire them - whether you are an experienced PM upskilling yourself, a newly inducted PM, or an aspiring PM. Product Thinking makes you focus on the outcome than the output & truly building the products that the customers will love! Developing & nurturing product thinking is not rocket science, but it takes time. And for a technology startup or a company focused on product-driven innovation, it absolutely makes sense to invest in people who reflect& product-focused mindset. In this session, Saurabh talks about how individuals at any level - whether they aspire to be a PM vs already a PM at various stages of their career need to continuously learn/unlearn to build a solid product mindset & product thinking culture for their organizations.

These audits are usually conducted within the organisation or with suppliers prior to series release, but also form a valuable contribution for process optimisation with already existing manufacturing lines. Furthermore, potential analysis – as part of VDA 6.3 – also constitutes a tried and tested method to select new suppliers. The third and complete revision of the VDA standard in 2016 had the main objective of simplifying and unifying the standard in order to give it a more practical and international orientation. With these new advantages, the worldwide importance of VDA 6.3 has increased. Moreover, this process audit standard can now also be applied to further sectors such as mechanical engineering and wind power. In order to conduct VDA 6.3 process audits, comprehensive knowledge,and competence are necessary. Thus, the qualification of relevant personnel is indispensable. In our VDA 6.3 trainings, the participants acquire the necessary background knowledge and understanding for process audit procedures. Target Audience This four-day training addresses QM personnel tasked with conducting process audits in their own organisations (internally) or in the supply chain (externally), as well as external auditors (deployment as service providers). OBJECTIVES Taking into consideration the process approach and the respective customer-specific requirements, this training introduces the basics for VDA 6.3 process auditors for holistic application in the automotive industry. This includes general requirements, methods, principles, the evaluation scheme, risk analysis. In addition, the underlying questionnaire is completely explained according to the assigned process elements (P1 – P7) so that participants can identify the respective risks along the supply chain and demonstrate the respective potential.

Through digital transformation, federal agencies look to deliver the same kinds of business or customer-focused digital experiences that are common in the commercial arena. The federal sector has been pursuing digital transformation for years through various avenues, including IT modernization, in an effort to replace inefficient, creaky legacy systems with more powerful, agile, interoperable and efficient technologies. These new systems are the foundation for transformative services and processes that break through agency silos and encourage closer collaboration across operations. That quest accelerated in the last year as agencies such as the Small Business Administration, the Internal Revenue Service and the U.S. Post Office rapidly developed and deployed new public-facing web services and resources to support pandemic remote work and relief efforts.

As the cruise sector gradually recommences operations, cruise retailers are gearing up to welcome guests onboard with a transformed retail offer to elevate the joy of the cruising experience. Last November, our highly successful virtual DFNI Cruise Seminar provided a state-of-the-industry update to the cruise retail sector, as this is constantly being shaped by the dynamic situation that Covid-19 has created across the cruising world. As the situation develops, this year’s DFNI Cruise Conference promises an expanded, insightful agenda to educate and assist brands, retailers and indeed, cruise lines on the changing dynamics onboard. Supporting the event again this year as Headline Sponsor is Starboard Cruise Services. Spanish fashion brand Desigual and Victorinox, maker of the world-famous pocket knife, as well as travel gear, accessories and fragrances, join the event as Sponsoring Partners for 2021. Swiss research agency m1nd-set also joins DFNI again this year as Research Partner. Dr Peter Mohn, Owner and CEO and Anna Marchesini, Head of Business Development, will present exclusive research into the ‘Intentions and expectations of future cruise and ferry travellers’. In Unchartered Waters: Cruise Retail Roundtable key cruise retail heads, including Bauer and MSC Head of Retail Adrian Pittaway, will offer their different perspectives on the route to recovery in the channel. Speakers will discuss how retailers and brands can plan amid changing consumer behaviour and habits, and adapt to be future fit. We are excited to announce new speakers for this year, Nadine Heubel, CEO Heinemann Americas and Jose Cuadra, Commercial Director, Heinemann Americas, who will kick off the second day of the conference to discuss Transforming Retail for the Ships of the Future. This year’s programme will also include a focus on the European ferry sector, an important sector for maritime travel retail. Cruises to nowhere, the reintroduction of UK-EU duty-free sales following Brexit, an increase in ‘local’ tourism and appetite for an expanded product offer suggests a bright outlook for the duty-free sector onboard European ferry routes. Meanwhile, cruise on-trade is one area that has been given little attention in cruise retail discussions in the past. Zachary Sulkes, Beverage Category Manager, Norwegian Cruise Line (TBC) Holdings is currently lined up to discuss the Experiential Opportunities in Retail and On-trade. A session focusing on Sustainability on the Seas will look at how the cruise retail sector onboard is playing its part – from logistics, streamlining and efficiency in the supply chain to sustainable packaging. We will round out discussions with a panel focusing on how brands have adapted their product offer, promotions, merchandising, andengagement strategies to the new normal. The 2021 DFNI Cruise Conference promises an expanded, insightful agenda to educate and assist brands, retailers and indeed, cruise lines on the changing dynamics of onboard retail. This year’s event is not to be missed – but hurry, our early bird rate ends soon! More information can be found: https://conference.dfnievents.com/dfnicruise2021"

As a class, we will walk through the SQF Edition 9 Food Manufacturing standard, offering lots of examples on how to cover off and implement the updated SQF standard. There are three main areas we cover: Part A – Basically how SQF Certification works Part B – Module 2 – The System Elements Part B – Module 11 – Good Manufacturing Processes of Food Products. Using the official SQFI training materials, we will go through each of the SQF Edition 9 requirements in a detailed and concise manner. We will give you lots of examples of how to conform to the SQF requirements while keeping your quality management system simple and straight forward. As we work through the SQF Edition 9 requirements, we map it out on a wall and gradually build a summary of the SQF Edition 9 manufacturing standard, outlining a rough ‘To-Do’ List on what needs to be done to achieve high SQF scores. We will cover the following: How does SQF certification operate and what does that mean for my business? Basic overview of the standard – what is it trying to achieve? How to set up a dropbox folder to manage a streamlined and efficient audit. What are the SQF requirements and what do they mean? How do I comply with the SQF requirements? QMS Audits writes up and assists a large number of clients with all of the GFSI standards, including SQF, BRC and FSSC22000. We use this expertise andto explain some non-conformances our clients have incurred and how we have closed them out. We also suggest practical ways to improve your facility as well as documentation including policies, procedures and your SQF quality manual.

Artificial Intelligence programs are used all over the world for collecting data, managing customer needs, and also helping with marketing at the same time. As we all know, a positivehas always been the best way to bring customers back to your business. If they enjoy purchasing from you they will keep coming back and in this digital era, customer service online requires multiple people to be employed, which is not always possible for a small business. That’s where Artificial Intelligence comes in handy, it helps with all the customer queries and makes the operations much smoother. Many businesses have a special team that spends hours writing emails for their customers and trying to make them as personalized for the customer as they can. Some of the research says that most of these emails written by these teams are not personalized and that’s where Artificial Intelligence through smart email content curation can fully understand how a customer interacts with the business owners' content. Artificial Intelligence makes it truly possible to send personalized emails to the customer by going through their topic of interest and buying habits to recommend the most relevant items. Artificial Intelligence assisted emails to help with engaging the customer and their needs. These email bots have now become an essential part of the digital business community. Most of the top Digital business houses and other online businesses have now shifted to 24 hours online customer service and this in most cases is -chatbots. Chatbots provide a smart customer service experience and they are often considered to be better than real humans in crafting personalized answers for the customers since they have access to more data than a human. Chatbots can look at your location to identify common issues and problems which other customers have faced in the past and relate them with yours, which helps in creating a far better customer service experience. It increases the rate of good customer service provided by the company. Chatbots can predict and identify patterns which cause problems for the user and help them based on their specific requirement. Chatbots can do way more than answer a customer’s problem, it can also advise on what to purchase based on their specific needs and hence creating a far more superior communication experience between the customer and the business. AI also helps organizations reduce errors and the agony of repetitive tasks on employees, specifically customer care call center employees. It’s not a replacement but more of assistance. The “human touch” will always be required for places AI cannot reach & of course to handle AI."

Hands-free. All organizations are adjusting to the new world, and nowhere is this felt more directly than HR, who are the face of the company for employees during these times. Unanticipated staffing changes (furloughing, re-hiring, recruiting temporary workers, changes to external contractors, short-time…) and all the employee documentation needed whilst working remotely really highlighted how challenging this is for HR - especially for companies that have not fully digitized their HR documentation processes. Shifting HR challenges are fueling the need for digital documents to support the explosion of remote workers and other efforts for reshaping the workforce. After all - when disruption happens, how you deploy your talent is what makes your business resilient and reliable – and no-one can afford to be slowed down by manual, cumbersome employee documentation processes. Switching to fully-digitized HR document processes empowers the HR organization to accelerate the staffing changes needed to ensure business continuity during times of change. Empower remote workers, leverage third-party infrastructure services, and deliver new ways to work with information.

Workshop One: The role of validation in early-stage business ideas (Tuesday, July 26 11am-2pm) You can think that your idea is so brilliant, and your mum and best mate can think that too, but in order to elevate your idea it is imperative that you know your customer, know your market and have a really clear idea of the problem-solution fit that your idea is bringing to the table. This session will guide you in doing just that, and you will have a clearer idea of what needs to be done to get your idea in tip-top shape.

The planning phase is a messy, creative and dynamic process - post its over hardcore plans, and pencils over pens, will set you in good stead for this workshop. This session will introduce you to lean startup concepts that you may consider in your business idea development, and we will show you how to use the Business Model Canvas in a way that gets you to spell out the nitty-gritty of your idea to reveal a business model that works.

This is even without the layer of fearing public speaking layered on top. In this session, we will cheer you on the way to creating a compelling pitch, and thus, the final part of your entry into the Deakin Startup Competition! From formulas to frameworks, storytelling to slide decks, we will share the bits of pitching you need to know about to get your startup off the ground.

This 8 week course explores mindfulness in a way that takes you on your own personal path, recognising that we are all experts on ourselves. ***** We learn to recognise our unsettled mind and build techniques to create inner space around our thoughts and emotions. ***** We come to understand the role of the body and how much it can tell us about our experience, learning that the mind is not always as helpful as we think but very powerful in driving our emotions. ***** We will look at our emotional system and come to understand how it can get out of balance, and learn techniques to bring it back into alignment so we can lead a more balanced life that supports our well being. ***** The course includes a number of practices that balance the body, mind and emotions, techniques which can be implemented daily. ***** Once we are familiar with the basics of mindfulness we move onto more advanced ideas that provide real insight into how the mind operates. ***** The course is taught by a teaching member of the Mindfulness Association, and as a result, your safety and confidentiality is of paramount importance. ***** The course includes a certificate of completion from the Mindfulness Association, a gateway to further learning. ***** Includes a free book and access to a free app with over 30 practices. Everyone will take something different away from the course but here are some of the benefits: Becoming less reactive Able to manage complex emotions more easily Being able to settle and calm the mind An overall sense of well being A less judgemental attitude towards yourself and others An opportunity to explore limiting self beliefs to live a more fulfilling life The course starts with an induction session and then 8 weeks of course material, so please allow 9 weeks in your calendar. An optional follow up session is included one month after course completion.Reviews ""Excellent course that challenges notions of what mindfulness is, while providing real tools to manage stress, worry and emotions.

She facilitates a warm and friendly atmosphere and is encouraging around all experiences."" ***** ""I really enjoyed the course I recently embarked on, Julie is a great teacher and made us all feel welcome in the group. I was a bit worried about learning via zoom but Julie lead the sessions really well with her extensive knowledge of the subject."" ***** ""I gained a deeper understanding of mindfulness with the ability to continue my practice going forward.

She was most influential in her local chapter of the American Advertising Federation, in which she served as president for six years, won eleven American Advertising Awards (ADDYs) for web design and print work and was honored with the coveted AAF Silver Medal Award in 2014. In this same year, she was elected to a four-year term on the American Advertising Federation’s District 9 Board of Governors, providing leadership to clubs and federations in Missouri, Iowa, Nebraska and Kansas. She was also a Waterloo Cedar Falls Courier 20 Under 40 award recipient and a finalist for Iowa Women of Innovation – Business Innovation and Leadership award.

I could go on that he is a member of the Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales and that he trained in the UK and has a BSc (Honours) in Business Finance and Economics from the University of East Anglia BUT what is important is that he is an extremely capable professional who cares about his fellow human beings.

When young professionals feel 'lost' or need solid advice they turn to Stavros (not Mr. Ioannou). When I want to make an impact with my speeches and training sessions I always pick his brains. He never told me (us) no. He always makes time for the people who are asking for his valuable time.

Almost 7 out of 10 millennials demand a seamless integratedfor services across all channels. Banks and Financial institutions incessantly try to improve and come up with better methods to onboard and retain customers. However, their legacy processes tend to be slow, repetitive, and expensive (it costs banks an average of $48m per year to onboard new customers!). Customers expect the same level of convenience from their banks and financial institutes as they receive from Amazon or Facebook. This has put an increased pressure on incumbent organizations to accelerate their digitization strategies. According to Fenergo, one in three (36%) financial institutions have lost customers due to inefficient or slow onboarding and 81% believe poor data management lengthens onboarding and negatively affects customer experience. Secure and frictionless omnichannel customer journeys are thus becoming the norm rather than a differentiator. In order for organizations to thrive in this post-pandemic digital age, efficient customer onboarding has to be an overwhelming priority. Leveraging technologies such as AI & ML (for assisted onboarding & analytics), Biometrics (includes face ID, fingerprint, voice recognition, iris scanning), and DLT (Blockchain for KYC) will determine long-term customer loyalty and retention. Early adopters are already writing their success stories and redefining the baseline for customer expectations.

Por ello, es necesario determinar y analizar cada punto de interacción con los clientes, y diseñar acciones estratégicas que permitan lograr momentos inolvidables para ellos En esta oportunidad ENDOCONSULTING, ofrece el curso de especialización: “CÓMO GESTIONAR LA EXPERIENCIA DE NUESTROS CLIENTES”, dirigido a profesionales interesados en identificar, diseñar e implementar estrategias de servicio y experiencia de cliente aplicables a la realidad de su empresa.

Thu Jul 22 06:17:52 2021,6820695512321183745,In 3 stappen de ROI op je Sitecore Experience Platform verbeteren,7,"Tue, Jul 27, 3:00 PM BST",https://www.linkedin.com/events/6820695512321183745/,"Heb jij ook een Ferrari en rijd je er vervolgens 80 kilometer per uur mee op de rechter rijbaan van de snelweg? Daar heb je hem niet voor gekocht, toch? Een analogie die veel gebruikt wordt als het gaat om het Sitecore Experience Platform. Een aantal jaar geleden is er binnen je organisatie besloten om Sitecore in te zetten als strategisch middel voor een betere Customer Experience. Centrale thema’s als een 360-graden klantbeeld, versnelling van de time to market, personalisatie, de marketeer aan het stuur en dergelijke zorgden ervoor dat Sitecore als beste uit de bus kwam. Nu, enkele jaren later, concludeer je dat het Sitecore Experience Platform ‘slechts’ als content management systeem wordt ingezet. En je vraagt je inmiddels drie zaken af: 1) Waarom is het Sitecore Experience Platform zo duur? 2) Halen we wel de beoogde waarde uit de investering? 3) Waartoe is het Sitecore Experience Platform eigenlijk in staat? Om meer waarde uit je Sitecore Platform, en dus je investering, te halen kun je in drie stappen klein beginnen (‘think big, act small’) en van daaruit langzaam groeien inmaturity. Op 27 juli 2021 geven we daarom het webinar “In 3 stappen een betere ROI van je Sitecore Experience Platform”. We vertellen en laten je zien wat je vandaag al kunt doen om je ambitie van morgen te bereiken. Schrijf je daarom nu in en schiet 2 december uit de startblokken om de ROI van je Sitecore Platform te verbeteren. Dit webinar is een herhaling. Vragen worden achteraf persoonlijk beantwoord, vermeld daarom alsjeblieft uw naam."

In such a scenario, how can legacy brands continue to stay top of mind and sustain patronage? DTC is not just a method of access. • It presents a space for experience innovation to bring the consumer closer to the brand. It offers the opportunity to build a mutually beneficial connection with the consumer. •It provides the potential to understand the consumer and their decisions better. DTC is reframed into DX (Dis-intermediation play) for legacy brands. Dis-intermediating brand experiences allow brands to meet the consumer in their environment, understand the consumer’s context and needs in a meaningful way, connect with them when it matters the most, leverage technology to go beyond fulfillment towards a more holistic, integral experience, and create value by constantly listening and iterating along with the consumer. The route to achieving this is rather complex. AI, engineering, and design are the silver lining that simplifies the route and helps brands achieve this DX sweet spot. In this session, listen to experts discuss the evolution of DTC and its reframing to DX play for legacy brands. •What should you do differently for your business to thrive? How can resilience translate to something more tangible? •How does transformation help to thrive? •Everything begins with identifying the problem, understanding the complexity, and investing in architecting an end-to-end state-change program.

Von Verteufelung bis Euphorie reicht das Spektrum der Meinungen wie KI die Contact Center verändert. KI bietet Contact Centern realistisch betrachtet, eine Vielzahl von Möglichkeiten. Traditionell haben Contact Center mit einem großen Kundenstamm und vielen Interaktionen Schwierigkeiten, die Bedürfnisse ihrer individuellen Kunden zu verstehen – eine Lücke die KI schließen kann, da sie die Segmentierung, Identifizierung und Bewertung von Kunden mit bisher nicht ausreichend genutzten Daten in Echtzeit ermöglicht. Viele Contact Center kämpfen heute mit einer wahren Flut an Interaktions-, Prozess- oder Metadaten. Die Verknüpfung von KI mit umfangreichen Daten aus CRM, Ticketing, E-Mail Management, Wissensdatenbanken, ACD´s  und anderen Systemen ermöglicht ein besseres Verständnis des Kaufverhaltens, der Präferenzen, der Loyalität oder der Zufriedenheit mit Touchpoints und Prozessen – all dies führt zu einer besserenExperience."

We can fall behind, keep up or set the pace. The role we take comes down to how well we foster innovative environments and approaches through software, practises and culture. And consistent innovation needs reliable systems. As more companies hire Site Reliability Engineers, rename their Ops teams to SRE teams and look into DevOps, the Cloud Native challenges reveal themselves quickly. So, why SRE? What is the business value? What about the costs and overall impact on the organisation? You can’t just throw a new set of practices at people and expect them to be excited about yet another seemingly haphazard change. But true Cloud Native isn’t haphazard - although it is reactive and built on the idea of continuous change, it stems from aligned strategy, culture and tech. In this session, we’re diving into: - The world of Cloud Native - its enchantment, challenges and business value. - Main SRE concepts and processes - The organisational changes needed to go from responsive to preventive maintenance. Our hands-onwith large enterprises shows us what successful and less successful SRE introductions look like - which we will also be sharing. Should you attend? If you’re at all interested in being an industry leader through reliable systems, improvedexperiences and innovative engineers, then yes.

Customer Centricity gehört zu den aktuellen Buzz-Words in der Unternehmenspraxis. Allenthalben werden entsprechende Projekte zur Etablierung einer stärkeren Kundenzentrierung in Unternehmen durchgeführt. Das scheint auf den ersten Blick verwunderlich, zumal Kundenorientierung doch eine altbekannte Grundlage im Marketing ist. Haben clevere Berater*innen und Agenturen lediglich ein neues Label für die gute, alte Kundenorientierung gefunden, um neue Aufträge zu erhalten? Oder fanden Start-ups die Bezeichnung „Kundenorientierung“ etwas zu altmodisch und Customer Centricity „cooler“? Oder ist Customer Centricity doch etwas anderes als Kundenorientierung? Welche Instrumente zur Kundenzentrierung gibt es denn? Und wie wird eine Kundenzentrierung eigentlich in Unternehmen etabliert? Über den Referenten Professor Dr. Mann und sein Team vom Marketing-Lehrstuhl der Universität Kassel geben Antworten auf diese und weitere Fragen rund um das Thema Customer Centricity. Zu den Forschungs- / Arbeitsgebieten des Lehrstuhls gehörenManagement, multisensuales Marketing sowie nachhaltiges Kaufverhalten und die Akzeptanz neuer (Kommunikations-) Technologien.

In such testing times, it is imperative for the insurers to think ahead of time and brace for an uncertain future. A well- laid out digital transformation and innovation strategy could pretty much allay these concerns and set the stage for a resilient and future-ready organization. In accomplishing these transformation and innovation priorities, they must aggressively bet their resources on critical success pillars viz. speed (time-to-market), agility, scalability, democratization, intelligence, governance, and efficiency/margin expansion. Low-code platforms have been leveraged effectively to deliver quantifiable business outcomes across various business functions of the insurance value chain, viz underwriting & policy management, marketing & sales,& engagement, claims processing, and risk management. We are thrilled to invite you to a webinar on how can Low-Code platforms accelerate innovation and digital transformation efforts for insurers.

The retail and consumer packaged goods (CPG) industry is embracing technology as it stands on the cusp of a massive shift, further accelerated by the pandemic. It is moving to a marketplace model where digital-native consumers are flooded with product choices and interaction channels with brands. Companies can no longer rely on traditional methods and business models to meet evolving consumer expectations. To successfully navigate this shift, retail and CPG companies need to develop an authentic connection with their consumers. Few companies have successfully managed to do so. These efforts also need to embrace key themes such as diversity of their talent, commitment to sustainability, and focus on memorable brand experiences. With digital transformation at the center of this shift, join us in this upcoming dialogue where Mindtree clients unravel how leading brands are delivering these experiences to customers.

And it’s only natural that CPAs and the businesses they serve have been affected as well. In the midst of all the uncertainty, one silver lining of the pandemic was that, as tax professionals, we learned strategies about how to approach tax season that we otherwise might not have come across, and how we and our clients alike might benefit from them in the future. Some of the main themes that emerged: FROM ONSITE TO OFFSITE As might be expected, the pandemic brought a rapid—and sometimes enduring—shift to remote work for many CPAs. NEW NEEDS, NEW REQUESTS The massive uncertainty associated with COVID-19 naturally unleashed a whole range of new and unprecedented requests and challenges from clients and others. We’ve adapted, adjusted and benefited from a lot of lessons learned’ Below are some of the takeaways from the last two tax seasons, and although we hope it’s an experience we never have to face again, these strategies can improve the process—even in the best of times. Planning has never been more important. Filing early is still a great strategy Know your firm, your clients and your staff. In this online CPE webinar, the following major questions will be answered: -> How did this past tax season go? -> Which factors contributed to the mess that the last two tax seasons were? -> What were the effects of government behavior and how to react? -> What are the effects of client behavior and how to react? -> What are the effects of staff behavior and how to react? -> What are the attributes of adaptable practice management systems?

Thu Jul 22 06:19:50 2021,6819520310711218176,Elevate the Leader in You #2: The Courage to be Bold with Jocelyn Pinet,246,"Mon, Jul 19, 10:30 PM BST",https://www.linkedin.com/events/6819520310711218176/,"This webinar is organized by Danielle Winandy and Pauline Bantegnie. We are friends and passionate about co-elevation, co-creation and self-development. We participate in many events, webinars, and conferences and there is always something missing from our point of view. We miss the actionable little thing we can take for ourselves to go further in the topic. Most events spark a light in our mind and are very useful, but when it comes to embed it in our day to day, in applying what we have learned, we are still craving for more tangible solutions. With this spirit, and in the spirit of co-elevation we launch “Elevate the Leader in You”. Inspired by the concept defined by Keith Ferrazzi that we love. Keith Ferrazzi introduced the idea of Co-Elevation. An approach to collaboratively achieve new levels of success through a team's commitment to co-create and challenge each other to go higher. Committed to the mission and each other. We believe the most accessible and precious tool is to learn from each other. Hence, we have decided to start this series of rendez-vous online to co-elevate the leader in you by engaging the conversation with the largest number of people we can. We aim to support your growth, by bringing here the people who inspire us, and by giving you concrete tools that you apply from tomorrow in your life or in your work. Leadership. Type the word on Google and in less than a second, you’ll have close to nine hundred million results. But none of it is leadership. Of course, you’ll find definitions of leadership and you'll have access to the greatest researchers and some best-selling authors and papers from the world’s top universities, . All will tell you how they see leadership. But like Magrite’s famous painting of a pipe with the caption ‘This is not a pipe’, nothing of what you’ll read will be leadership. So then, what is leadership? During the 35 years of Jocelyn Pinet as a consultant, he had the opportunity to work with heads of state, company presidents, accomplished artists and famous thinkers. He worked with managers of small teams, with school teachers and students, with sport team coaches, social workers, policemen and women, farmers and business owners. Some of them were great leaders. Others, not so much. Histaught him that there’s only one way to know what leadership really is. And that’s when you see it. When you see someone doing what no one else is doing at that particular moment, when you see someone making a brave decision or point to a path that no else sees, you see leadership. When you see a person challenge the status quo or help people see beyond their limits, you see leadership. When you hear someone speak out when everyone else is silent or remain silent when everyone else wants to be heard, you see leadership. At that moment, all these people are expressing leadership. And at that moment, they all have one thing in common; they are bold. During our next Linkedin webinar, Jocelyn Pinet, the author of the book Be Bold will help us develop our leadership by exploring what makes us bold…and what stops us from being bold! These 30 minutes can very well change the way you think about leadership! Be bold! Be with us! Jocelyn Pinet is a speaker, a facilitator, a consultant and an author who’s been helping organisations gather stakeholders around common visIons, goals and strategies since 1986. He works with the management of leading public and private organizations in Europe, Asia and America to help them better understand the challenges they are faced with and find ways to meet them. Recognized for his ability to turn words and concepts into powerful images and for his dynamic, interactive and pragmatic approach, he has facilitated thousands of events around the world for all types of companies. In his home base of Quebec, Canada, he is acknowledged for his contribution to key events designed to advance the thinking on social, economical and environmental issues. As a specialist in leadership challenges, he has published numerous articles on related topics and has authored 5 books, namely Human Nature, an international best seller. His last book, Be Bold, co-authored with the late Olivier Bouleau, is designed to help individuals develop leadership behaviors in their personal and professional lives. Jocelyn was one of the founders and president of Quebec’s Association forService and was member of the advisory committee for the Québec Quality Movement. He is strategic adviser on social and environmental responsibility for the Institut du Nouveau Monde in Quebec and specializes in the impact of new technologies on leadership with Technomedia (now CEGID) in France, USA and Canada.

As a PM, there is a lot of temptation to fast track through the Product Discovery phase and start building something because the Product Delivery phase feels more tangible and less ambiguous. It also makes stakeholders happy because the project looks as if it’s moving forward. Product Discovery is often less tangible and glamorous, and you could be spending weeks on doing user research to come up with seemingly “obvious” insights. However, this is the critical work that needs to happen to validate assumptions, uncover user motivations, and paint a well-rounded picture of the problem space you’re in. The risk of rushing through this problem identification and prioritization step is that there is a higher chance you’re not actually building the right product in the right sequence to solve your customer’s core needs. You may reduce one or two pain points, but the cause of the problem still exists and unaddressed. It could feel like the product is never finished because the users are still asking for features to fulfill needs that you thought you already solved. How do we avoid this cycle? Today, I will be talking about three tools that I have used to focus on identifying the problem to solve and bringing the stakeholders onto that journey to shift their mindset when gathering requirements. Main takeaways: - The five why’s - a tried-and-true method to effectively uncover user needs. - Leveraging the JTBD framework - what are your customers trying to accomplish? - How do you know you’ve solved the problem? Defining success metrics with your customers from the beginning. Meet the Speaker: Cindy Chen Cindy has 8+ years ofin Product and UX across SaaS, ad-tech, Telecomm, Fintech in B2B and B2C markets.

Die Plattform als solche wird mit einem enormen Aufwand abgesichert. Microsoft kümmert sich um die physische und logische Sicherheit der Infrastruktur, die Administration (UX), Sicherheit auf App-Ebene sowie behördliche Kontrollen und Branchenzertifizierungen (wie z. B. HIPPA). Wir als Kunden der Plattform Microsoft 365 müssen aber auch noch etwas für den Schutz unserer Daten tun. Um der eigenen Verantwortung nachzukommen, müssen wir folgende Bereiche / Herausforderungen (je nach M365-Plan) mit einer eigenen Lösung ergänzen: - Mail-Security - Zum Schutz vor Malware, Ransomware, Hacker - Backup - Zum Schutz vor Löschung von wichtigen Daten, ob versehentlich oder böswillig - Archivierung - Anforderungen der internen Rechts- und Compliance-Beauftragten - Schaffung von Sensibilität hinsichtlich Datensicherheit Wir wollen Sie in unserem Webinar darüber informieren wann Drittanbieterlösungen sinnvoll sind und welche Funktionen Sie in ihrem Microsoft 365-Plan unbedingt aktivieren sollten.

Die Analyse und das Management dieser Informationen, geschieht aber in vielen CX-Abteilungen noch händisch. Künstliche Intelligenz kann dabei unterstützen: Denn KI-Technologien wie die Textanalyse haben über die letzten Jahre an Reife gewonnen und können das CXM im richtigen Kontext eingesetzt sinnvoll ergänzen, indem sie Feedback-Daten normalisieren, strukturieren und für die Weitergabe konsolidieren. 💡 SMARTE PRAXISBEISPIELE FÜR DAS CX-MANAGEMENT 💡 Erfahren Sie in diesem Webinar anhand zweier Use Cases, wie Sie mit Unterstützung smarter Algorithmen Kundenfeedback aufbereiten und analysieren können. Die Textanalyse beispielsweise erstellt eine sortierte Übersicht aller Kundenkommentare nach positiven und negativen Bewertungen und bündelt unter anderem Kundenanfragen und ihre Vorschläge. Das ermöglicht detailliertere und vor allem authentische Insights zur Qualität des Kundenerlebnisses. Bei Themenclustern hingegen wird das Kundenfeedback semantisch ausgewertet und kategorisiert. CX-Teams wissen so automatisch, welche Inhalte Kunden aktuell am meisten beschäftigen. Beide Ansätze verwandeln das Kundenfeedback in eine transparente Datenbasis, deren Kernaussagen dann beispielsweise in einem Journey-Dashboard analysiert und in Echtzeit überwacht werden können. KI vereinfacht damit nicht nur das Datenmanagement, sondern unterstützt Teams auch aktiv bei der Bewertung von Insights. ❗️ Weitere Themen ❗️ Welches Potenzial bieten smarte Algorithmen für ein nachhaltiges CX-Management? Welche Insights gewinnen CXM Teams mittels Textanalyse aus dem Kundenfeedback? Welche Analysemöglichkeiten bieten intelligente Themencluster?"

La maggior parte delle persone è legata a grandi aziende che lottano per mantenersi competitive e all'altezza delle aspettative e dei bisogni in continua evoluzione dei clienti. Ecco perché il libro “The Phoenix and the Unicorn” di Peter Hinnsen parla di una creatura altrettanto magica, ma che forse rappresenta una fonte di ispirazione più realistica: la Fenice. Queste sono le aziende Volvo, Disney, Apple, Microsoft, Ping An, Assa Abley e AT&T che, proprio come questo mitico uccello, sono capaci di ripensare sé stesse ciclicamente, di volta in volta risorgono dalle loro ceneri e ne escono più forti che mai. Si tratta quindi di capire che cosa sta succedendo in un mondo in costante trasformazione, oltre che di prendere esempio e di imparare dagli Unicorni. Principalmente si racconta di come le aziende possano agire sul loro “Day After Tomorrow” (Peter Hinssen 2017) e utilizzare l'innovazione come rimedio in un mondo che cambia radicalmente in poco tempo. Hinssen perciò non si focalizza solo su cosa è necessario fare per innovare, ma anche su come rendere l’innovazione una realtà nelle organizzazioni. Molti i temi del libro: il modello della clessidra, ingannevolmente semplice, i vari tipi di innovazione, la cultura aziendale, la disruption, le piattaforme, lae la struttura organizzativa. Se lavorate in un business o in un mercato tradizionale, questo libro vi aiuterà a reinventarvi proprio come una Fenice."

Want to connect Azure functions securely and learn the balance of Microsoft Teams security and usability? Join us online for free on Microsoft Teams Live Event with our guest speakers Joel Rodrigues, Zoe Wilson and Luke Evans. Agenda (UK time): 16:00-16:10 - Welcome & Introductions 16:10-17:00 - Securely connect to SharePoint online from Azure function - Joel Rodrigues MVP This session covers some of the considerations when building a secure application that runs as an Azure Function and securely connects to SharePoint. The connection is easily done by using an Azure Active Directory application registration and a certificate, but how do we ensure that the certificate is secured but still accessible by the function? By taking advantage of the great integration between service applications and key vaults! Let's throw PowerShell, Azure Functions, Azure AD apps, Managed service identity, Key Vault, ARM templates and a few other things onto the mix and create a base solution that is secure, reusable and easy to deploy. You can then focus your effort on the things that matter - the function itself! 17:00-17:10 - Break 17:10-18:00 - Microsoft Teams Usability vs Security - Zoe Wilson and Luke Evans With unprecedented growth of Microsoft Teams. In many cases, Teams was thrown out quickly with little planning or governance, to shift to remote working. End-users have adopted Teams and love the freedom to work, collaborate in the open with colleagues, customers and partners alike. Microsoft Teams is a fantastic tool for supporting cross-functional and even cross-organisational collaboration, but its openness introduces concerns about unfettered file and data sharing between users. Historically, effective security came at the expense of usability & usability came at the expense of security. Many continue to go by the notion that there is no way to achieve both effective security and usability simultaneously - but with Microsoft Teams, and the wider M365 security and compliance capabilities, it can be possible to achieve secure collaboration. 18:00 - Finish Speaker Profiles: Joel Rodrigues MVP, SharePoint Developer, Storm Technology I am a SharePoint developer at Storm Technology with over 10 years of SharePoint development experience. Having worked with all versions since SharePoint 2007, I have a special preference for SharePoint Online as it allows me to use the latest tools available to build very interesting solutions. My favourite part of the SharePoint development ecosystem is the amazing community, who created the best development tools SharePoint has ever had.

They admire the landscaping, enjoy the attractions, and marvel at the seemingly seamless delivery of service. What they don’t notice, because it is intentionally hidden, is the finely timed and choreographed process machine that makes themagical. You might think that a creative person like Walt Disney would have disdained process. The opposite was true. He was obsessed with it. Animation was expensive. Codifying the animation process helped control costs. The trick was to standardize the process without stifling creativity. It was only natural that, when it came time for Walt to translate his movie empire into a live-action theme park, those parks would be driven by process. Prior to building Disneyland, Walt Disney spent a prodigious amount of time identifying process issues. Disneyland solved those process issues in advance. And once opened, continuous efforts were made to improve the processes behind the experience. Walt called it “plussing,” and he was always looking for ways to plus the guest experience. Process plussing is where the real magic happens, and organizations gain theirservice edge. Bad processes can be overcome by hard-working staff, but staff who do not feel supported by the organization eventually move to the competition. Bad processes also squander money, time, and morale while pushing frustrated customers away. Effective processes save money as they generate new revenue, make more effective use of employee time, improve employee morale, and turn average customers into devoted fans. To the customer, the experience appears as if by magic. But behind the scenes, it is a meticulously planned process that makes the magic In this insightful session, Lenn Millbower, The Mouse Man™, pulls back the curtain so you can learn how Disney approaches process improvement. Attend this session and learn how to make your own process magic. Participants Will Learn - 3 underlying causes of most process issues. - Several examples of Disney process issues, solutions, and successes. - The leader’s role in delivering effective process plusses. - The critical importance employees play in fixing process issues. - A method for identifying, testing, and solidifying process improvements. Who Should Attend - Training and HR professionals - Managers and supervisors - Anyone interested in Disney"

Es gibt kaum ein Unternehmen, das sich nicht verstärkt nach den Wünschen und Erwartungen seiner Kunden ausrichten und die Erfahrungen entlang der Customer Journey optimieren möchte. Gleichzeitig entstehen zunehmend Abteilungen, die dezidiert das Thema(CX) im Unternehmen verantworten. Das Aufgabenspektrum eines CX Managers ist ungemein vielschichtig. Dazu gehören neben methodischen auch vermehrt technische Kompetenzen, wenn es um die Generierung von Kunden-Insights geht. Daneben kommt CX Managern eine zentrale Rolle zu, CX im Unternehmen strukturell zu verankern, den kulturellen Wandel voranzutreiben und vieles mehr. Leider gibt es für diese vergleichsweise junge Profession noch keine spezifischen Ausbildungsangebote. Nachdem wir in der jüngsten Vergangenheit des Öfteren auf diese Lücke angesprochen wurden, haben wir dies zum Anlass genommen, ein Trainingsprogramm zu entwickeln, dass diese Kernkompetenzen vermittelt. WAS IST DIE CX ACADEMY? Die CX Academy ist eine gemeinschaftliche Institution von MSR Insights und InMoment. Uns verbindet eine langjährige Kooperation und die klare Fokussierung auf ein Thema:Management. In Ergänzung sehen wir uns in der Lage, CX ganzheitlich zu betrachten und auf alle Anforderungen, die an einen CX Manager gestellt werden, einzugehen. WAS ERWARTET SIE? Der Ausbildungsgang zum CX Master richtet sich an alle, die für das CX Programm eines Unternehmens in zentraler Rolle Verantwortung tragen. Durch unseren modularen Aufbau kommen sowohl Einsteiger wie auch Erfahrene auf ihre Kosten. Im Vordergrund steht weniger die Theorie, sondern das praktische Handwerkszeug, das CX Manager im Alltag benötigen. Ein hoher interaktiver Schulungsanteil und die zu bearbeitenden Fallstudien sorgen dafür, dass neues Wissen unmittelbar angewendet wird. Nicht zuletzt erwarten wir ein intensives Networking und Erfahrungsaustausch der Teilnehmer untereinander – auch außerhalb der Trainings. Wir sehen in der CX Academy somit auch einen Beitrag zum Auf- und Ausbau einer lebendigen CX Community im deutschsprachigen Raum. Wir freuen uns aus Sie."

Es gilt, diese Komponenten bestmöglich miteinander zu verzahnen, um Kunden ein übergreifendes und überzeugendes Erlebnis über alle relevanten Touchpoints hinweg bieten zu können.

Warum ist eine belebende Working Experience so wichtig für den Erfolg Ihres Unternehmens? Diese und weitere Fragen klären Linda Kröger (Business Consultant & Projektleiterin bei Communardo) und Dr. Peter Geißler (Head of Communardo Consulting) zusammen mit Ihnen und unserem Gast Florian Schink (Customer Success Manager Modern Work bei Microsoft Deutschland) im Dialog.

Mobilität, das Auto, die Infrastruktur – all das muss endlich neu gedacht werden. Es reicht nicht mehr an den kleinen Stellschrauben zu drehen. Politik, Wirtschaft und Gesellschaft müssen gemeinsam neue Technologien, Konzepte und Geschäftsmodelle zur Zukunft der Mobilität pushen! Automobilhersteller, Zulieferer und Konzerne aus der Tech-Welt arbeiten seit einigen Jahren intensiv an vernetzten, automatisierten und datengetriebenen Lösungen, bauen eigene Plattformen, eigene Betriebssysteme und befinden sich damit im Kampf um den Kunden. Der CCI Summit greift diese marktverändernden Entwicklungen auf und will den Entscheidern, den Stakeholdern, den Neudenkern aus Auto- und IT-Branche eine Plattform geben, die Dynamiken der neuen Ökosysteme zu diskutieren und einzuordnen. Beim CCI Summit erfahren Sie, welche: _ Automobil-Hersteller in der Connected Car Innovation Studie von Prof. Dr. Bratzel in diesem Jahr die Innovationskraft haben, _ Auswirkungen die Connected Car Innovationen auf die zukünftige Marktstellung der Automobilhersteller haben werden und _ ob die Innovationskraft der etablierten Automobilhersteller in den letzten Jahren ausreichen wird, sich gegen die aufkommenden Player aus China durchzusetzen.
